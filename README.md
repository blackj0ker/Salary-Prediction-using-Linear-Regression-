# Salary-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression-

Overview
This project aims to predict salaries based on various factors using the Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. Predicting salaries accurately can be crucial for both employers and employees during the hiring process, negotiation, and workforce planning.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about employees, including their years of experience, education level, and other relevant features. The dataset is available in the "data" directory and is named "salary_data.csv".

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Before applying machine learning algorithms, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Building: The Linear Regression algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

Requirements
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
